               <p class="writeup"> How many times have you failed? - once , twice? I can't even count that on my fingers , the number of times I have failed while achieving what I have today. One thing I learnt through my failures is that you have to pull yourself together and learn from your mistakes , it may take you more than once or even twice to realize where or when you went wrong , but once you realize you will never have to look back! Failure is the stepping stone to success. - Harsha </p>

                <p class="writeup">In may 2021 my mother and I tested positive for positive for covid 19. We tend to live life as it comes, one day at a time, but after diagnosed with covid I started looking at the bigger picture.  Am I satisfied with who I am? Where I am? Is this my ceiling. When you are looking for something in life, life opens up doors for you. All you have to do is start looking. I started looking and found out that I like coding and I am good at coding. And doors are starting to open now, for me to be a softwate developer soon.
                Start looking and start searching. You have one life. - Karthik</p>

                <p class="writeup">It was year 2018 I was  at my friends place in Delhi and my family didn’t knew about it that I was in Delhi  and due to an accident my brother died and he was on trip Jaisalmer and my family knew about it. It was a really bad time for me and my family so I was overthinking that I was one who should have died and I was into a shell like I was not taking to anyone and I was falling everywhere after an year or so I my friend helped me out to come out of this trauma.So now I can’t forget what happened but still I have realized that there only one life and I cannot keep on cursing myself for that what has happened and I have become successful in this life only - Raghavender</p>

                <p class="writeup">It was two years back, when I have just passed out from my collage . I didn't get any job from my collage . At first I was not so worried about it . I thought I could manage to get a job soon. But something happened and the whole planet was in a stand still mode, it was covid . It was the time when I started to get tensed , but I thought this will pass. I ignored it and kept on searching for job .

                    But the situation didn't improve, it got worse day by day. As the days went by my thoughts kept growing, I started to get desperate to get a job. I started to lower my expectations day by day . I started to contact friends and relatives to get any job. Though everyone told they will try their best but I got a sense that those are just courtesy. 
                    
                    Days passed by and now it has been one and half year I was unemployed. I was broken and didn't know what to do . So I did the easiest thing that I could have done. I started to divert myself , I stated to drink and smoke keep my self away from home, away from family gatherings for as long as I could just to avoid the obvious question from my parents -"what next". The days were passing fast I kept myself busy with friends, enjoying and doing everything to distract myself.
                    
                    But deep down I was unhappy, I was in a so much bad mental state I couldn't sleep at night. My parents gave up hope on me they even stopped asking me after a point about my life. Instead of having so many friends and relatives I felt that I was alone, there was no one who understood my feelings.
                    
                    Finally one day something happened that was an eye opener for me. I was with my friends and the was a friend whom I have met after a long he asked me what I was doing , I told nothing . He replied "then what's the point of so much studying and wasting your parents so much money". I was speechless . I never expected this type of insult. Many of my friends were there expecting me to come up with a come back line but the question shook me. I couldn't say anything . I just smiled back. 
                    
                    The incident hurt me , it hurt my Ego. I started thinking how get revenge and get back to him. But as I thought of it I realized, getting back at him is not a solution. I realized that may be he told that on my face but there are many people who think the same thing . I realized how I was wasting my life and have changed to someone who is a shame for his parents.
                     
                    I told myself if I give up and forget this incident then I am looser. I decided to fight for my pride not physically but with my success story. I told myself anyhow I have to start a career. I started to see my past mistakes , how I was too lazy at times, how I have wasted my precious time; and also how I can do a new start.
                    
                    I decided to learn Software Development . It was hard , I knew nothing . I had to learn everything from scratch. But I told myself only one thing - "Six month of struggle sixty years of life". I kept pushing myself . Finally at a stage I started enjoying coding . In quest of my self respect I found my life's path. All the negative thoughts started reducing day by day . Finally now I am in a state where I can forgive myself for all my mistakes and look forward to life and success which I hope to achieve soon. - Tuhin</p>
