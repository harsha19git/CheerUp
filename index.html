               <p class="writeup"> How many times have you failed? - once , twice? I can't even count that on my fingers , the number of times I have failed while achieving what I have today. One thing I learnt through my failures is that you have to pull yourself together and learn from your mistakes , it may take you more than once or even twice to realize where or when you went wrong , but once you realize you will never have to look back! Failure is the stepping stone to success. - Anonymous </p>

                <p class="writeup">In may 2021 my mother and I tested positive for positive for covid 19. We tend to live life as it comes, one day at a time, but after diagnosed with covid I started looking at the bigger picture.  Am I satisfied with who I am? Where I am? Is this my ceiling. When you are looking for something in life, life opens up doors for you. All you have to do is start looking. I started looking and found out that I like coding and I am good at coding. And doors are starting to open now, for me to be a softwate developer soon.
                Start looking and start searching. You have one life. - Anonymous</p>
